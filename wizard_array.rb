# As we have seen, arrays can be defined to contain
# 	many items of the same type

my_array = ['zero','one','two','three','four']


# we can access one of these items by its index in the arrays

my_array[2] #returns the value 'two'


# we can also use the index to SET a value in the arrays

my_array[2] = 'TWO'
# my_array[2] is now equal to 'TWO'


# We can even have arrays containing many different
#   data types. Here well create a 'wizard' object

my_wizard = ['Gandalf the Grey', 10000, 'Middle Earth', 'You Shall Not Pass', true, nil]


# write a function that finds and returns the index of my_wizard's quote below
# you're going to need to know the quote beforehand, so you can loop through the array
# and look for the quote 'You Shall Not Pass'.




# now write a function that prints the value returned by the function you just wrote above




 
# call your print quote function here and run this file to see the result
