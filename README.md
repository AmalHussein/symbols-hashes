#Hashes, Symbols

As we have seen, arrays can be defined to contain
	many items of the same type

```ruby 
my_array = ['zero','one','two','three','four']
```


we can access one of these items by its index in the arrays

```ruby 
puts my_array[2] #outpus 'two' 
```


we can also use the index to SET a value in the arrays

```ruby 
my_array[2] = 'TWO'
puts my_array[2] #outpus 'TWO'
```


We can even have arrays containing many different
  data types. Here well create a 'wizard' object

```ruby
my_wizard = ['Gandalf the Grey', 10000, 'Middle Earth', 'You Shall Not Pass', true, 'Balrogs', 'Total Badass']
```


Now this is all ok, if you remembered or noted somewhere that:
```ruby
my_wizard[0] #is name,
my_wizard[1] #is age,
my_wizard[2] #is location,
my_wizard[3] #is famous quote,
my_wizard[4] #is whether or not our wizard is epic, and
my_wizard[5] #is weaknesses
my_wizard[6] #is status
```

##But...
### we begin to see some shortcomings (at least with our wizard example). 

1. There is no evident association between the index of the array and the information it contains.
2. If we are storing diverse information, there is no key that identifies what each piece of information represents.
3. As a product of the first shortcoming, it is very difficult and time-inneficient to fetch or update information if we don't already know where it is. For example, looking up "Gandalf the Grey" by famous quotes might consist of something like:

```ruby
# assume all_wizards is a collection of wizards like the one we defined above
all_wizards.each do |wizard|	#iterates over each of our wizards
	wizard.each do |information| #iterates over single wizard info
		if information == 'You Shall Not Pass'
			return wizard
		end
	end
end
```

##What ever could we use?

#Hashes

A hash is a ruby data structure that allows us to define sets of key-value pairs. The key can then be used to access the value Before any further explaination, take a look at how it's done:

```ruby
my_wizard = {
    name: 'Gandalf the Grey',
    age: 10000,
    location: 'Middle Earth',
    quote: 'You Shal Not Pass',
    epic: true,
    weaknesses: 'Balrogs',
    status: 'Total Badass'
}
```

Already we see a much more organized data structure. Each piece of information is denoted by a key, and we can now access the information by the key. So, if I wanted to see my_wizard's name, I could access it like so: 

```ruby
    #we could write
    my_wizard[:name] #this would return 'Gandalf the Grey'
    
    # or
    my_wizard[:name] = 'Ratagast the Brown' # this would reset the name of the wizard
```

So like arrays, we can think of hashes as containers for storing information. However, hashes unlike arrays allow us to attach  specific identifying keys for easy access to values.

## Hash Syntax and Symbols

###Syntax

Lets walk through how we defined the  hash above:

we start with the variable name

`ruby
my_wizard
`

then we give it a set of curly braces, inside of which we will eventally define our key value pairs

`ruby
my_wizard = {}
`
    *note: you can always define an empty hash and give it key value pairs later
    
to define a key value pair, we place the key on the left, a colon, and then the value we want associated with our key on the right.

`ruby
name : 'Gandalf the Grey'
`

if we have multiple key value pairs, we use the same syntax and add commas at the end of each key value pair (except for the last one)

`ruby
name: 'Gandalf the Grey",
age: 10000,
quote: 'You shall not pass'
`

you will also see the "hash rocket" syntax floating around

`ruby
:name => 'Gandalf the Grey
`

I personally do not use this sytax, because I feel like the colon sytax is cleaner and more readable, but many developers
do use. You will probably see this most often with older ruby code, and you should be able to recognize and use it. As a side not, this sytax actually clearly highlights the fact that our key is in fact a symbolâ€¦ 

###Symbols

You may have noticed the ':' before the key when we accessed information from the Hash ( :name ), and again when we saw hash rocket notation. We could also define our hash using strings as our keys:

```ruby
my_wizard = {
    "name": 'Gandalf the Grey',
    "age": 10000,
    "location": 'Middle Earth',
    "quote": 'You Shal Not Pass',
    "epic": true,
    "weaknesses": 'Balrogs',
    "status": 'Total Badass'
}
```
'ruby
:key #this is a symbol
"key" #this is a string
:"key" #this is a symbol
'

So what is the difference between strings and symbols? The difference is that while in ruby, strings are mutable (they can be changed after assignment), symbols are not (they are immutable). Lets see an example to understand the implications of this difference.

```ruby
my_string = "I'm Sorry"
my_string += " Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"
puts my_string 
>> "I'm Sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"

:my_symbol = :"I'm Sorry"
:my_string += :" Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"
>> NoMethodError: undefined method `+' for :"I'm Sorry":Symbol
```
As we can see, while we can concatinate two string together to form one string, the same does not hold true for symbols.

We can also convert between symbols and strings like so:

```ruby
:hello.to_s
>> "hello"

"hello".intern
>> :hello

"hello".to_sym
>> :hello
```

It's worth noting that the intern and to_sym functions are exactly the same. to_sym is simply an alias for intern.
