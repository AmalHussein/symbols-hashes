# Again, write a function that returns a wizards quote from the hash
# that uses symbols as keys. You'll notice this function is much shorter
# than the one from the arrays file




# Now, write the same function that returns a wizards quote from the
# hash that uses strings as keys.




# And a function that prints the values from both of the functions you wrote above



 
# call your print quote function here
